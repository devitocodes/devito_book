# Coming soon

Hang in there! For the **Wave Equations** chapter, we're still working on:

* Generalization: reflecting boundaries
* Generalization: variable wave velocity
* Building a general 1D wave equation solver
* Analysis of the difference equations
* Finite difference methods for 2D and 3D wave equations
* Implementation
* Applications of wave equations

Check back later to see the Devito tutorials for these sections!

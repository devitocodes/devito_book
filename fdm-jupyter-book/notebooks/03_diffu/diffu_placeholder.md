# Coming soon

Hang in there! For the **Diffusion Equations** chapter, we're still working on:

* An explicit method for the 1D diffusion equation
* Implicit methods for the 1D diffusion equation
* Analysis of schemes for the diffusion equation
* Diffusion in heterogeneous media
* Diffusion in 2D
* Applications

Check back later to see the Devito tutorials for these sections!

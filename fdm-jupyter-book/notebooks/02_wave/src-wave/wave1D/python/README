wave1D_u0.py:
  Standard, linear, constant coefficient wave equation in 1D with
  u=0 and the boundaries. Scalar implementation.

wave1D_u0v.py:
  As wave1D_u0.py, but adding vectorized code for the loop over
  inner points in the time loop.

wave1D_n0.py:
  As wave1D_u0.py, but with du/dx=0 as boundary condition at both ends.

wave1D_n0_ghost.py:
  As wave1D_n0.py, but using ghost cells/points/values to implement
  the Neumann condition.

wave1D_dn.py:
  Standard, linear, constant coefficient wave equation in 1D with
  flexible boundary conditions: either a time-varying Dirichlet
  condition or a homogeneous Neumann condition at each boundary point.
  Scalar and vectorized implementation (using index sets).
  Contains many test examples.

wave1D_dn_vc.py
  A counterpoart to wave1D_dn.py, but with variable coefficient (wave
  velocity).

1D wave equation with homogeneous Neumann conditions::

  u, x, t, cpu = solver(I, V, f, c, L, dt, C, T, user_action)

Function solver solves the wave equation

   u_tt = c**2*u_xx + f(x,t) on

(0,L) with du/dn=0 on x=0 and x = L.

dt is the time step.
T is the stop time for the simulation.
C is the Courant number (=c*dt/dx).
dx is computed from dt and C.

I and f are functions: I(x), f(x,t).
user_action is a function of (u, x, t, n) where the calling code
can add visualization, error computations, data analysis,
store solutions, etc.

Function viz::

  viz(I, V, f, c, L, dt, C, T, umin, umax, animate=True)

calls solver with a user_action function that can plot the
solution on the screen (as an animation).

    "We may start by looking at [Figure](#diffu:pde1:FE:fig:F=0.51)\n",

    "initial condition, we see that the curves are indeed smooth.\n",
    "The problem with the results in [Figure](#diffu:pde1:FE:fig:F=0.5)\n",
    "is that the initial condition is discontinuous. To represent it, we\n",
    "need a significant amplitude on the shortest waves in the mesh.\n",
    "However, for $F=0.5$, the shortest wave ($p=\\pi/2$) gives\n",
    "the amplitude in the numerical solution as $(1-4F)^n$, which oscillates\n",
    "between negative and positive values at subsequent time levels\n",

    "This section presents the complete computational algorithm, its\n",

    "A real implementation of the basic computational algorithm from\n",
    "the sections [Formulating a recursive algorithm](wave1D_fd1.ipynb#wave:string:alg) and [Sketch of an implementation](wave1D_fd1.ipynb#wave:string:impl) can be\n",
    "encapsulated in a function, taking all the input data for the problem\n",
    "as arguments.  The physical input data consists of $c$, $I(x)$,\n",
    "$V(x)$, $f(x,t)$, $L$, and $T$.  The numerical input is the mesh\n",
    "parameters $\\Delta t$ and $\\Delta x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of specifying $\\Delta t$ *and* $\\Delta x$, we can specify one\n",
    "of them and the Courant number $C$ instead, since having explicit\n",
    "control of the Courant number is convenient when investigating the\n",
    "numerical method. Many find it natural to prescribe the resolution of\n",
    "the spatial grid and set $N_x$. The solver function can then compute\n",
    "$\\Delta t = CL/(cN_x)$. However, for comparing $u(x,t)$ curves (as\n",
    "functions of $x$) for various Courant numbers\n",
    "it is more convenient to keep $\\Delta t$ fixed for\n",
    "all $C$ and let $\\Delta x$ vary according to $\\Delta x = c\\Delta t/C$.\n",
    "With $\\Delta t$ fixed, all frames correspond to the same time $t$,\n",
    "and this simplifies animations that compare simulations with different\n",
    "mesh resolutions. Plotting functions of $x$\n",
    "with different spatial resolution is trivial,\n",

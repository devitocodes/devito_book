    "in terms of classes. This gives a richer application programming interface\n",
    "(API) since a function solver must have all its input data in terms\n",
    "of arguments, while a class-based solver naturally has a mix of method\n",
    "arguments and user-supplied methods. (Well, to be more precise,\n",
    "our solvers have demanded `user_action`\n",
    "to be a function provided by the user, so it is possible to mix variables\n",
    "and functions in the input also with a solver function.)\n",

    "We will next illustrate how some of the functionality in `wave1D_dn_vc.py`\n",

    "the amount of repetitive code. We therefore take the opportunity to illustrate\n",
    "how this may be counteracted by introducing a super class `Parameters` that allows \n",

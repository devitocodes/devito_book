    "use different numerical methods for different physical processes. This can\n",
    "optimize and simplify the overall solution process. The idea was\n",
    "especially popularized in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations\n",
    "and reaction-diffusion PDEs. Common names for the technique are *operator\n",
    "splitting*, *fractional step* methods, and *split-step* methods. We shall\n",
    "stick to the former name.\n",
    "In the context of nonlinear differential equations, operator splitting\n",
    "can be used to isolate nonlinear terms and simplify the solution methods.\n",

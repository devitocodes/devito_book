    "Models leading to diffusion equations, see the section [diffu:app](#diffu:app), are\n",

    "concentration, temperature, and velocity.  The underlying physical\n",
    "processes involve complicated microscopic movement of atoms and\n",
    "molecules, but an average of a large number of molecules is performed\n",
    "in a small volume before the modeling starts, and the averaged\n",
    "quantity inside this volume is assigned as a point value at the\n",
    "centroid of the volume. This means that concentration, temperature,\n",
    "and velocity at a space-time point represent averages around the\n",
    "point in a small time interval and small spatial volume.\n",

    "Random walk is a principally different kind of modeling procedure\n",

    "obviously the case with the three `random_walk1D*` functions we\n",

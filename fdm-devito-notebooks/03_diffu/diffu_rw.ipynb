    "Models leading to diffusion equations, see the section [Applications of diffusion equations](diffu_app.ipynb), are\n",
    "usually based on reasoning with *averaged* physical quantities such as\n",
    "concentration, temperature, and velocity.  The underlying physical\n",
    "processes involve complicated microscopic movement of atoms and\n",
    "molecules, but an average of a large number of molecules is performed\n",
    "in a small volume before the modeling starts, and the averaged\n",
    "quantity inside this volume is assigned as a point value at the\n",
    "centroid of the volume. This means that concentration, temperature,\n",
    "and velocity at a space-time point represent averages around the\n",
    "point in a small time interval and small spatial volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random walk is a principally different kind of modeling procedure\n",
    "compared to the reasoning behind partial differential equations.  The\n",
    "idea in random walk is to have a large number of \"particles\" that\n",
    "undergo random movements. Averaging can then be used afterwards to\n",
    "compute macroscopic quantities like concentration. The \"particles\"\n",

    "behavior of molecules, much simpler and computationally much more\n",
    "efficient than direct [molecular simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics), yet the random\n",
    "walk model has been very powerful to describe a wide range of\n",
    "phenomena, including heat conduction, quantum mechanics, polymer\n",
    "chains, population genetics, neuroscience, hazard games, and pricing\n",

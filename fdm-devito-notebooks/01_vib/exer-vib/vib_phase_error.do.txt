TITLE: Exercise: Investigate phase errors
AUTHOR: hpl
DATE: today

We have an exact solution $I\cos (\omega t)$ and an
approximation $I\cos(\tilde\omega t)$. The corresponding periods
are $P=2\pi/\omega$ and $\tilde P=2\pi/\tilde\omega$, respectively.
After $m$ periods, the exact solution reaches its peak point $I$
at $t_m=m2\pi/\omega$, while the numerical solution reaches the
similar peak point at $\tilde t_m=m2\pi/\tilde\omega$. The error
in the peak point location is
!bt
\[ e =t_m - \tilde t_m
= m2\pi\left(\frac{1}{\omega} - \frac{1}{\tilde\omega}\right),\]
!et
and seen to be a linear function of $m$ (given $\Delta t$).

Welcome to the Devito Book!
============================

This book is full of tutorials that focus on the finite difference (FD) method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), using Python and Devito. We hope that by doing these tutorials, you can gain a better understanding of how the finite difference method works, while also learning Devito at the same time!

We would like to say a special thank you to H. P. Langtangen and S. Linge, the authors of the book that these tutorials were based upon ("Finite Difference Computing with PDEs - A Modern Software Approach").

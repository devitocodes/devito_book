## The Devito Book

The Devito Book is a set of tutorials that focus on the finite difference (FD) method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), using [Devito](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito). It is largely based on ["Finite Difference Computing with PDEs - A Modern Software Approach"](https://github.com/hplgit/fdm-book) by H. P. Langtangen and S. Linge.

The tutorials are available as a [Jupyter Book](https://devitoproject.org/devito_book). They are also available on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/devitocodes/devito_book/master) as a set of Jupyter notebooks.

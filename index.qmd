This book teaches finite difference methods for solving partial differential equations through Python implementations.

## About this Edition {.unnumbered}

This is the Quarto edition of *Finite Difference Computing with PDEs - A Modern Software Approach*, originally authored by Hans Petter Langtangen and Svein Linge. The content has been converted to Quarto format to enable modern web-based publishing.

## Book Structure {.unnumbered}

The book covers:

1. **Vibration ODEs** - Finite difference discretization for oscillatory systems
2. **Wave Equations** - Methods for wave propagation in multiple dimensions
3. **Diffusion Equations** - Heat transfer and related diffusion processes
4. **Advection-Dominated Equations** - Convection and transport phenomena
5. **Nonlinear Problems** - Techniques for nonlinear differential equations

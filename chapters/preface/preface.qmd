### Acknowledgment

I first encountered Hans Petter Langtangen's work through his book *A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python* [@Langtangen_2012], which I used to develop my first lecture course on Python programming for geoscientists. When I contacted him for advice on teaching introductory programming to domain scientists, he was remarkably generous and helpful, even providing his lecture slides to help me get started. His approach to teaching computational science has been formative in shaping my own teaching ever since.

Professor Langtangen passed away in October 2016. I am deeply grateful to both him and Svein Linge for their contributions to computational science education and their commitment to open-access publishing and open-source software. Their original work provided an excellent foundation for this edition.

This work was prepared in collaboration with the Devito development team.

## Original Preface

*The following preface is from the original work by Langtangen and Linge.*

There are so many excellent books on finite difference methods for
ordinary and partial differential equations that writing yet another
one requires a different view on the topic. The present book is not
so concerned with the traditional academic presentation of the topic,
but is focused at teaching the practitioner how to obtain reliable computations
involving finite difference methods. This focus is based on
a set of learning outcomes:

 1. understanding of the ideas behind finite difference methods,
 1. understanding how to transform an algorithm to a well-designed computer code,
 1. understanding how to test (verify) the code,
 1. understanding potential artifacts in simulation results.

Compared to other textbooks, the present one has a particularly strong
emphasis on computer implementation and verification. It also has a
strong emphasis on an intuitive understanding of constructing finite
difference methods. To learn about the potential non-physical
artifacts of various methods, we study exact solutions of finite
difference schemes as these give deeper insight into the physical
behavior of the numerical methods than the traditional (and more
general) asymptotic error analysis. However, asymptotic results
regarding convergence rates, typically truncation errors, are crucial
for testing implementations, so an extensive appendix is devoted to
the computation of truncation errors.

### Why finite differences?

One may ask why we do finite differences when finite element and
finite volume methods have been developed to greater generality and
sophistication than finite differences and can cover more
problems. The finite element and finite volume methods are also the
industry standard nowadays. Why not just those methods?  The reason
for finite differences is the method's simplicity, both from a
mathematical and coding perspective. Especially in academia, where
simple model problems are used a lot for teaching and in research
(e.g., for verification of advanced implementations), there is a
constant need to solve the model problems from scratch with
easy-to-verify computer codes. Here, finite differences are ideal. A
simple 1D heat equation can of course be solved by a finite element
package, but a 20-line code with a difference scheme is just right to
the point and provides an understanding of all details involved in the
model and the solution method. Everybody nowadays has a laptop and the
natural method to attack a 1D heat equation is a simple Python or
Matlab program with a difference scheme. The conclusion goes for other
fundamental PDEs like the wave equation and Poisson equation as long
as the geometry of the domain is a hypercube. The present book
contains all the practical information needed to use the finite
difference tool in a safe way.

Various pedagogical elements are utilized to reach the learning outcomes,
and these are commented upon next.

### Simplify, understand, generalize

The book's overall pedagogical philosophy is the three-step process of
first *simplifying* the problem to something we can *understand* in
detail, and when that understanding is in place, we can *generalize*
and hopefully address real-world applications with a sound scientific
problem-solving approach.  For example, in the chapter on a particular
family of equations we first simplify the problem in question to a 1D,
constant-coefficient equation with simple boundary conditions. We
learn how to construct a finite difference method, how to implement
it, and how to understand the behavior of the numerical solution. Then
we can generalize to higher dimensions, variable coefficients, a
source term, and more complicated boundary conditions.  The solution
of a compound problem is in this way an assembly of elements that are
well understood in simpler settings.

### Constructive mathematics

This text favors a constructive approach to mathematics. Instead of
a set of definitions followed by popping up a method, we emphasize how
to think about the construction of a method. The aim is to obtain a
good intuitive understanding of the mathematical methods.

The text is written in an easy-to-read style much inspired by the
following quote.

> *Some people think that stiff challenges are the best device to
> induce learning, but I am not one of them. The natural way to learn
> something is by spending vast amounts of easy, enjoyable time at it.
> This goes whether you want to speak German, sight-read at the
> piano, type, or do mathematics. Give me the German storybook for
> fifth graders that I feel like reading in bed, not Goethe and a
> dictionary. The latter will bring rapid progress at first, then
> exhaustion and failure to resolve.*

> *The main thing to be said for stiff challenges is that inevitably
> we will encounter them, so we had better learn to face them boldly.
> Putting them in the curriculum can help teach us to do so. But for
> teaching the skill or subject matter itself, they are overrated.*

This book assumes some basic knowledge of finite difference approximations,
differential equations, and scientific Python or MATLAB programming,
as often met in
an introductory numerical methods course. Readers without this background
may start with the light companion book "Finite Difference Computing with
Exponential Decay Models" [@Langtangen_decay]. That book will in
particular be a useful resource for the programming parts of the present book.
Since the present book deals with partial differential equations, the
reader is assumed to master multi-variable calculus and linear algebra.

Fundamental ideas and their associated scientific details are first
introduced in the simplest possible differential equation setting,
often an ordinary differential equation, but in a way that easily
allows reuse in more complex settings with partial differential
equations. With this approach, new concepts are introduced with a
minimum of mathematical details. The text should therefore have
a potential for use early in undergraduate student programs.

### All nuts and bolts

Many have experienced that "vast amounts of easy, enjoyable time", as
stated in the quote above, arises when mathematics is implemented on a
computer. The implementation process triggers understanding,
creativity, and curiosity, but many students find
the transition from a mathematical algorithm to a working code
difficult and spend a lot of time on"programming issues".

Most books on numerical methods concentrate on the mathematics of the
subject while details on going from the mathematics to a computer
implementation are less in focus. A major purpose of this text is
therefore to help the practitioner by providing *all nuts and bolts*
necessary for safely going from the mathematics to a well-designed and
well-tested computer code. A significant portion of the text is
consequently devoted to programming details.

### Python as programming language

While MATLAB enjoys widespread popularity in books on numerical
methods, we have chosen to use the Python programming language. Python
is very similar to MATLAB, but contains a lot of modern software
engineering tools that have become standard in the software industry
and that should be adopted also for numerical computing
projects. Python is at present also experiencing an exponential growth
in popularity within the scientific computing community. One of the
book's goals is to present an up-to-date Python eco system for
implementing finite difference methods.

### Program verification

Program testing, called *verification*, is a key topic of the book.
Good verification techniques are indispensable when debugging computer
code, but also fundamental for achieving reliable simulations.
Two verification techniques saturate the book: exact solution
of discrete equations (where the approximation error vanishes) and
empirical estimation of convergence rates in problems with
exact (analytical or manufactured) solutions of the
differential equation(s).

### Vectorized code

Finite difference methods lead to code with loops over large
arrays. Such code in plain Python is known to run slowly.  We
demonstrate, especially in Appendix @sec-ch-softeng2, how to port
loops to fast, compiled code in C or Fortran. However, an alternative
is to vectorize the code to get rid of explicit Python loops, and
this technique is met throughout the book. Vectorization becomes closely
connected to the underlying array library, here `numpy`, and is often
thought of as a difficult subject by students.  Through numerous
examples in different contexts, we hope that the present book provides
a substantial contribution to explaining how algorithms can be
vectorized. Not only will this speed up serial code, but with a
library that can produce parallel code from `numpy` commands (such as
[Numba](http://numba.pydata.org)), vectorized code can be
automatically turned into parallel code and utilize multi-core
processors and GPUs. Also when creating tailored parallel code for
today's supercomputers, vectorization is useful as it emphasizes
splitting up an algorithm into plain and simple array operations,
where each operation is trivial to parallelize efficiently, rather
than trying to develop a "smart" overall parallelization strategy.

### Analysis via exact solutions of discrete equations

Traditional asymptotic analysis of errors is important for
verification of code using convergence rates, but gives a limited
understanding of how and why a correctly implemented numerical method
may give non-physical results. By developing exact solutions, usually
based on Fourier methods, of the discrete equations, one can obtain a
physical understanding of the behavior of a numerical method. This
approach is favored for analysis of methods in this book.

### Code-inspired mathematical notation

Our primary aim is to have a clean and easy-to-read computer code, and
we want a close one-to-one relationship between the computer code and
mathematical description of the algorithm.  This principle calls for a
mathematical notation that is governed by the natural notation in the
computer code. The unknown is mostly called $u$, but the meaning of
the symbol $u$ in the mathematical description changes as we go from
the exact solution fulfilling the differential equation to the
symbol `u` that is naturally used for the associated data structure
in the code.

### Limited scope

The aim of this book is not to give an overview of a lot of methods
for a wide range of mathematical models.  Such information can be
found in numerous existing, more advanced books.  The aim is rather to
introduce basic concepts and a thorough understanding of how to think
about computing with finite difference methods.  We therefore go in
depth with only the most fundamental methods and equations.  However,
we have a multi-disciplinary scope and address the interplay of
mathematics, numerics, computer science, and physics.

### Focus on wave phenomena

Most books on finite difference methods, or books on theory with
computer examples, have their emphasis on diffusion phenomena.  Half
of this book (Chapters @sec-ch-devito-intro, @sec-ch-wave, and Appendix
@sec-ch-softeng2) is devoted to wave phenomena. Extended material on
this topic is not so easy find in the literature, so the book should
be a valuable contribution in this respect.  Wave phenomena is also a
good topic in general for choosing the finite difference method over
other discretization methods since one quickly needs fine resolution
over the entire mesh and uniform meshes are most natural.

Instead of introducing
the finite difference method for diffusion problems, where one soon
ends up with matrix systems, we do the introduction in a wave
phenomena setting where explicit schemes are most relevant. This slows
down the learning curve since we can introduce a lot of theory for
differences and for software aspects in a context with
simple, explicit stencils for updating the solution.

### Independent chapters

Most book authors are careful with avoiding repetitions of material.
The chapters in this book, however, contain some overlap, because we
want the chapters to appear meaningful on their own. Modern publishing
technology makes it easy to take selected chapters from different
books to make a new book tailored to a specific course.
The more a chapter builds on details in other chapters, the more
difficult it is to reuse chapters in new contexts. Also, most readers
find it convenient that important information is explicitly
stated, even if it was already met in another chapter.

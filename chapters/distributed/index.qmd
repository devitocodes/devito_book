# Distributed Computing and Scalability

This chapter introduces distributed computing techniques for scaling PDE
solvers to large problems. We cover Devito's automatic domain decomposition
with MPI, task-based parallelism with Dask for embarrassingly parallel
workloads like shot-parallel seismic imaging, and hybrid approaches
for multi-node GPU clusters.

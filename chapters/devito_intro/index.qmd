# Introduction to Devito {#sec-ch-devito-intro}

This chapter introduces Devito, a domain-specific language (DSL) for
solving partial differential equations using finite differences. We begin
with the motivation for symbolic PDE specification, then work through
a complete example using the 1D wave equation.

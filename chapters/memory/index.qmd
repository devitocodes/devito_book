# Memory Management and Wavefield Storage

This chapter addresses the critical challenge of memory management in
large-scale wave propagation simulations. We develop techniques for
efficient wavefield storage using Devito's `ConditionalDimension`,
introduce checkpointing strategies for adjoint computations, and
discuss I/O strategies for production-scale simulations.

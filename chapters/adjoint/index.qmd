# Inverse Problems and Adjoint-State Methods

This chapter introduces inverse problems in the context of seismic imaging
and Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI). We develop the mathematical framework
of the adjoint-state method and implement key algorithms including forward
modeling, Reverse Time Migration (RTM), and gradient computation using
Devito's explicit API.
